# N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides implementations of the N-Queens problem in Python, Java, and Ruby.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer N, the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The program will output all possible arrangements of the queens on the board.

## Features

- Solves the N-Queens problem for an 8x8 chessboard (8 queens).
- Implements backtracking to find all valid configurations.
- Provides a visual representation of the chessboard with queens placed.

## Implementations

This project includes implementations in the following programming languages:

- [Python](n_queens.py)
- [Java](NQueens.java)
- [Ruby](n_queens.rb)

## How to Run

### Python

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the Python code in a file named `n_queens.py`.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python n_queens.py
